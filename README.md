# A Goodness-of-fit Test for Log-Linearity in Cox Proportional Hazard Model under Monotonic Covariate Effects #

This repository contains  ```R``` codes for the article “A Goodness-of-fit Test for Log-Linearity in Cox Proportional Hazard Model under Monotonic Covariate Effects.” 
We proposed a goodness-of-fit (GOF) for the linearity versus isotonic effects in the Cox PH Model. 
Deviation of the partial likelihood ratios suggests a non-linear effect. 
The critical values were determined by Monte Carlo random samples from the ordinary Cox Model with linear interpolated Breslow estimation of the baseline hazard function. 
In the end, some extensions and discussions beyond the paper were provided. 
<!--Lastly, we discuss the proposed GOF tests beyond the GOF tests. -->
