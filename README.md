# A Goodness-of-fit Test for Log-Linearity in Cox Proportional Hazard Model under Monotonic Covariate Effects #

This repository contains  ```R``` codes for the article “A Goodness-of-fit Test for Log-Linearity in Cox Proportional Hazard Model under Monotonic Covariate Effects.” 
Based on the partial likelihood ratios, we proposed a goodness-of-fit (GOF) for the linearity effect in the Cox Model. 
<!--Lastly, we discuss the proposed GOF tests beyond the GOF tests. -->
<!-- This article has been submitted for publication. -->

## Part 1. Reproducing size and power comparison results with a residual-based GOF test in the manuscript.

## Part 2. Reproducing the assessments of the robustness of the GOF tests with baseline hazards.
